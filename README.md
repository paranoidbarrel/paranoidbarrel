# ðŸ‘‹ &nbsp;Hi there

I'm a software developer, I make open-source projects that solve unique problems by bringing solutions to realy life problems. I love combining my hobbies like rapid prototyping, coding and building various projects. Obsessed with building and maintaining homelabs as sysadmin stuff. Check out my website [paranoidbarrel.dev](https://paranoidbarrel.dev) for more.

## ðŸ‘‡ &nbsp;Current project

I'm currently working on a Drone Assisted Weed Detection and Spraying Mechanism. It is a drone mounted weed detection model trained using labelled datasets. It detects and sprays the detected weeds in real time reducing manial labour while also increasing weed spraying accuracy thus preventing poisoning of produce.
